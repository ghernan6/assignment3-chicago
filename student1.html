        <h2>Academic Experience</h2>
        <p>I am currently double majoring in psychology and computer science, which gives me 2 different sets of problem-solving techniques. My academic background in computational coding inspired me a lot when I do behavior coding and helps me coming up with ways to optimize the coding system. Also, due to the nature of most of the computer science classes, I have a lot of experience working on teams for projects.</p>
