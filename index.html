  <!--Since the commanality between the students is related to academics (double majoring) and they're all majoring in CS, why don't we go for bright text against a dark background and use fonts that look like coding fonts (monospaced an dkind of blocky). A possible font pairing could be: Roboto Slab(headers) and Cutive Mono(p), but other fonts are fine as long as they fit with this mood and are legible.-->

      <!--Design: Let's have the navigation in the top-right. Also, the usual stylings for menu: no underlines for hypertext, make them clickable boxes instead of clickable text, let's have the menu be arranged vertically instead of horizontally, to make sure all of the names fit at smaller screen sizes.-->
